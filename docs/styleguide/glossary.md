## What's the glossary purpose?

**AsyncAPI's** glossary is a collection of terms and concepts that are commonly used throughout the product's documentation. It helps technical writers, developers, and other types of contributors stay consistent in their usage of these terms and concepts when writing tutorials and other forms of content for the product.

## Tips for Contributors

When adding a new term to the glossary, updating the definition of an existing term, or adding a new concept to the glossary, consider doing the following:

- ✅ **Provide clear yet specific definitions and descriptions**: This helps ensure that the glossary is easy to understand and use.
- ✅ **Keep it plain and simple**: Avoid using jargon or technical terms in the descriptions. This ensures that the glossary is accessible to a wide audience that may not be familiar to everyone.
- ✅ **Use sentence case for definitions**: This makes the glossary easier to read and navigate.
- ✅ **Present them in alphabetical order**: This makes it easier for users to find the term or concept they're looking for.
- ✅ **Use bold and italics**:  This makes it easier to distinguish between terms and concepts.

## Formatting Guidelines

When writing terms and concepts in the glossary, use the following formatting guidelines:

- ✅ Use `###Term Name` for as the term's headings.
